# Operations

Services and logs. To be written.

## Buttons

Four buttons down the back edge of the panel:

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| A | Next display mode |
| B | Show species names on/off |
| C | Rotate the display 90° clockwise |
| D | Next artwork style |

These settings are saved and will override any settings set in the admin panel.
Give the panel up to a minute to catch up - it redraws slowly.

## Updates

The frame checks GitHub hourly for new releases and shows it on the admin
page's System tab. Press **Install** to update, or toggle on *Install new releases automatically* so that the frame updates itself.

Installing takes a minute or two, and the page shows how far it has got. The
frame restarts itself and comes back on the new
version. If an update fails, the
reason shows in place of the version and the frame keeps running as it was.

Some updates also bring a new version of BirdNET-Go, which is a few hundred megabytes and may take a while to download. (Your detections will be automatically backed up to `detector/data/birdnet.db.bak`.) This happens only while Fugleramme is the one running BirdNET-Go (a detector you run yourself is never touched).

The frame has to be online to check for or install updates, whichever way you do
it. The System tab tells you whether it is.

### Over SSH

To update by hand, using the version shown in the admin page:

```bash
ssh <user>@<host>.local
cd ~/quigebirds
git fetch --tags
git checkout <version>
uv sync
sudo systemctl restart fugleramme-frame
```

## Re-running the install

`./run.sh` re-applies everything the installer did, minus the initial machine setup:

```bash
ssh <user>@<host>.local
cd ~/quigebirds
./run.sh
```

Run it if you move the repo or swap the mic.

## Changing the ports

`FRAME_PORT` is the web interface, `BIRDNET_PORT` is BirdNET-Go when Fugleramme
runs it. Both are located in `frame.env`:

```bash
ssh <user>@<host>.local
cd ~/quigebirds
nano frame.env
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` is what bakes the port into the service, so a plain restart isn't enough.
Moving `BIRDNET_PORT` also means changing the address under **Detector** on the
admin page. Updates never touch either.

## Pointing the frame at a different BirdNET-Go

The admin page's Detector tab has the address, and a password for an instance
with Basic Authentication configured (OIDC not supported yet). Saving takes
effect straight away (no restart). **Test connection** lets you check before
saving the changes.

The frame reads detections only. Everything about how birds are detected stays
in BirdNET-Go's own settings.

If Fugleramme was running a BirdNET-Go of its own and you move the frame to
another instance for good, re-run `./install.sh` and answer 2 or 3. It offers to stop
the old container and hand the port back, so updates stop pulling an image
 and you stop the running container. Your detections stay in `detector/data` either way. Changing only the address on the admin page leaves the old container running, which is what you want if you plan to point back in the future.

## Enabling authentication for the admin page

By default anyone who can reach Fugleramme can change its settings. On the
Security tab, tick **Require sign-in for the admin page**, set a password and
**Save**. The page then asks you to sign in. You stay signed in for a week, and
changing the password signs everyone out. The kiosk is always public.

If you forget the password, set a new one in [the settings file](troubleshooting.md#locked-out-of-the-admin-page).

> [!NOTE]
> The password travels over plain HTTP. If the frame is reachable from the
> internet, put HTTPS in front of it and tick the proxy box.

### Behind a reverse proxy

Five wrong passwords in fifteen minutes block that visitor. Behind a proxy every
visitor has the same IP, so a stranger's guesses would block you
too. Tick **The frame is behind a reverse proxy** and the frame counts per
visitor again. Leave it off if the frame's own port is open to
the internet as well: anyone reaching it directly can claim any address.

## Changing Wi-Fi in gadget mode (USB-C)

For moving the frame to a new network, or onto one you can't reach it over yet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Will only be possible if gadget mode has been enabled.

```bash
ssh <user>@10.12.194.1 # or <user>@<host>.local if you've enabled internet sharing on your computer 
nmcli device wifi list
sudo nmcli --ask device wifi connect "<SSID>"
```
