"""Inky panel init and push, with graceful degrade.

The frame service owns the panel and treats it as optional: if the Inky library
or the physical device is absent (as off-Pi), we log a warning and return
None so the caller runs web-only.

The attached panel's own resolution is authoritative for its render, and for the
kiosk's shape while the kiosk is locked to the panel. The render is sized as the
viewer sees it, so `push` turns it back into the panel's native landscape, which
is the only buffer the driver accepts.
